This is a simple website that is embedded in a QR Code with a base64 data uri.

**Hello**: Welcomes the visitors with a big "HELLO"!

**What I do for a living**: I turn coffee into bugs

## Acknowledgements
- **HTML5**: You need to make the webpage with something
- **CSS3**: No JavaScript though, its less than 3 KB (fr, its just 1.9KB)
- **Base64** : For encoding into data uri
- **Python** : I don't really like the Language, just used it for making the QR
